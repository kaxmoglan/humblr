# humblr

A social media platform built with React, Redux, Material, Express and Firebase.

Users can create an account and a profile with a profile image, bio, website link and location. They can create posts (called ‘Murmurs’) and comment, like and unlike other users’ posts in realtime. Notifications are generated for new comments and likes (unread notifications also get deleted should a user remove their like) and profile pictures get deleted from the server automatically should the user upload a new one.

Far from being the next Facebook, but a fun project to practise with a realtime database, Redux and making APIs!

## The concept

The concept of Humblr is to encourage its users to share interesting things outside of themselves. Examples might include a thought-provoking article, a great book you’ve just finished, film you watched or a thought-provoking piece of artwork.

Examples of discouraged posts include pictures of your dinner and club-bathroom selfies.

In a world so full of self-promotion, celebrity and materialism, we hope our users will enjoy contributing to the internet murmur by starting great conversations, challenging opinions and sharing new discoveries, and maybe making social media a Humblr place in the process.
